🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction Project in Egypt (Dubizzle Properties)🌟 Project OverviewThis project focuses on building a high-accuracy Machine Learning Regression Model to predict residential unit prices within the Egyptian real estate market, utilizing data aggregated from an online property classifieds platform.Core Objective: To identify the primary factors driving real estate prices and develop a robust predictive model.Tools and Libraries: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost).Model Status: Achieved moderate accuracy (R² around 51% before tuning), indicating the need for additional features and data volume to reach professional accuracy standards (80%+).💾 The DatasetThe dataset was compiled from property listings and initially contained 4500 rows (prior to cleaning).Feature NameDescriptionExample ValuetitleListing Title"Apartment 3 rooms immediate delivery..."priceUnit Price (The Target variable)4,492,000 EGPareaUnit Area (Square Meters)151 sqmbedsNumber of Bedrooms3bathsNumber of Bathrooms3compound / locationCompound or Area NameTagamoa 1 / Diar 1🧹 Data Preprocessing and Feature EngineeringTo ensure optimal model performance, several critical steps were executed:Data Cleaning: Removal of non-numeric characters (EGP, sqm) and type conversion for numerical columns.Outliers Removal: The Interquartile Range (IQR) method was used to remove extreme outliers from price, area, baths, and beds.Categorical Feature Handling (Target Encoding):Instead of standard One-Hot Encoding (which yielded low R²), Target Encoding was applied to the compound feature.A new feature, Compound_Value (the mean price of properties in that compound), was created. This proved to be the single most powerful predictor.🤖 Modeling and EvaluationMultiple regression models were tested to evaluate performance:ModelInitial R² ScoreFinal R² Score (Post-Target Encoding)Linear Regression (MLR)0.27N/ARandom Forest Regression0.310.51 (Best Performer)XGBoost Regressor0.45Lower than RF🎯 Key Findings and Feature ImportanceThe model successfully validated market intuition by identifying the most significant drivers of price:FeatureImportance ScoreConclusionCompound_Value66.7%Dominant Factor: The location's average value is the strongest predictor.area24.4%Secondary Factor: Unit size is highly relevant after controlling for location.baths / beds< 6%These features contribute marginally to the final price prediction.📈 Challenges and Future WorkTo achieve the target professional accuracy ($R^2 > 0.80$):Data Augmentation: Collect a significantly larger dataset (> 10,000 rows) to stabilize the model and improve the accuracy of Target Encoding.Missing Features: Incorporate critical data points currently missing, such as Finishing Quality, Floor Number, and Delivery Status.Hyperparameter Tuning: Systematically tune the Random Forest model parameters (e.g., using RandomizedSearchCV) to extract the maximum possible performance from the existing data.
